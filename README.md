# Final Year Project: Scam Detection Model

This repository contains the code and resources for my final year project, which focuses on building a scam detection model.

## About the Project

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of detecting various types of scams, frauds, or deceptive practices. The model utilizes techniques such as natural language processing (NLP), anomaly detection, and machine learning algorithms to identify suspicious behavior or content.

## Contents

- `scam_detection_model.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the scam detection model.
- `data/`: Directory containing datasets used for training and evaluation.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

To use the scam detection model:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open and run the `scam_detection_model.ipynb` notebook in a Jupyter environment.
4. Follow the instructions within the notebook to train and evaluate the model.
